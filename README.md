# Feb20 Test Mocks Mob Coding

# Challenge
To develop a object contructor function for a electronic payment system (let's call it a Lobster Card).

- It should have access to a range of ticket types.
- It should expect to recieve an object representing a payment card.
- It should have a way to record every transaction it has made that day.
- It should be able to deduct the money from the payment card.

We will only be writing the source code for the payment system. All the other objects will be mocked in the test suite (ticket, payment, lobsterCard).
